# hubot-rocketchat

Hubot adapter for Rocket.Chat!

Feel free to join us in the [#hubot](https://open.rocket.chat/channel/hubot) channel to discuss hubot, and any scripts you might be working on.

## Important

**BREAKING CHANGES:** v2.x.x contains major breaking changes. Starting with this version:
* CoffeeScript BOTs will no longer be supported, all new bot scripts should be written in NodeJS 8 compatible JavaScript
* Only [Hubot v3](https://github.com/hubotio/hubot/tree/v3) will be supported
* you should only use [Rocket.Chat Server version 0.63.0](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/releases/tag/0.63.0) or higher
* Yeoman generator support is discontinued,  you should start your project with our [hubot v3 boilerplate](https://github.com/RocketChat/hubot-rocketchat-boilerplate)
* [NodeJS 8](https://nodejs.org/) or later is required for operations
* The latest ES6 syntax in NodeJS 8, including the popular async-await, is fully supported

v1.x.x versions of the adapter is only compatible with 0.37.1 and higher of Rocket.Chat Server.  Yes, you should be able to continue using v1.x.x adapter and CoffeeScript bots with the most up-to-date version of the server.

If you are using Rocket.Chat 0.35.0 or earlier, please use v0.1.4 of the adapter.  (releases between 0.35.0 and 0.37.1 are not recommended for hubot operations)

#### NOTE
If you want to integrate Rocket.Chat with GitHub or GitLab.  Make sure you visit the [Rocket.Chat.Ops](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.-Chat.Ops) project before starting. We already have many scripts that add webhook events and access GitHub/GitLab APIs. You can easily extend these scripts for your custom application.

### For v2.x.x of the Adapter  (Hubot v3 and ES6 support)

If you are writing CoffeeScript bots, need Hubot 2.x and v1.x.x or v0.x.x of the adapter, please see [instructions for v1.x.x of the adapter](#For-v1.x.x-and-v0.x.x-of-the-Adatper).

The following instructions are ONLY for v2.x.x of the adapter.

#### Getting your bot connected to Rocket.Chat

Here is a sample run:

![picture of a sample interaction with rocketbot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sing-Li/bbug/master/images/botpic.png)

We have a couple of ways for you to get up and started with the Rocket.Chat adapter.

##### Docker

You can quickly spin up a docker image with:

```
docker run -it -e ROCKETCHAT_URL=<your rocketchat instance>:<port> \
	-e ROCKETCHAT_ROOM='' \
	-e LISTEN_ON_ALL_PUBLIC=true \
	-e ROCKETCHAT_USER=bot \
	-e ROCKETCHAT_PASSWORD=bot \
	-e ROCKETCHAT_AUTH=password \
	-e BOT_NAME=bot \
	-e EXTERNAL_SCRIPTS=hubot-pugme,hubot-help \
	rocketchat/hubot-rocketchat
```

##### Custom Scripts

If you want to include your own custom scripts you can by doing:

```
docker run -it -e ROCKETCHAT_URL=<your rocketchat instance>:<port> \
	-e ROCKETCHAT_ROOM='' \
	-e LISTEN_ON_ALL_PUBLIC=true \
	-e ROCKETCHAT_USER=bot \
	-e ROCKETCHAT_PASSWORD=bot \
	-e ROCKETCHAT_AUTH=password \
	-e BOT_NAME=bot \
	-e EXTERNAL_SCRIPTS=hubot-pugme,hubot-help \
	-v $PWD/scripts:/home/hubot/scripts \
	rocketchat/hubot-rocketchat
```

#### Creating a User on the Server

An admin user is required to create the account for the bot to login to.

1. From **Administration** > **Users** menu
2. Select `+` to make a new user
3. Enter *Name*, *Username*, *Email* (tick verified) and *Passwword*
4. Disable *Require password change*
5. Select `bot` from role selection and click *Add Role*
6. Disable *Join default channels* recommended, to avoid accidental listening
6. Disable *Send welcome email*
7. *Save*

Use these credentials in the bot's environment `ROCKETCHAT_USER` and
`ROCKETCHAT_PASSWORD`

Note that for bots email, a common workaround to avoid creating multiple
accounts is to use gmail +addresses, e.g. `youremail+botnam@gmail.com`.
[See this issue for more](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/issues/7125)


### Building a Bot

Please see our boilerplate bot [Getting Started docs here][getting-started]!

The boilerplate is essentially just a simple node package that requires Hubot,
the Rocket.Chat adapter and Coffeescript for its execution...

```
"dependencies": {
    "coffeescript": "^2.2.2",
    "hubot": "3",
    "hubot-rocketchat": "^2.0.0"
}
```

The bot can then be executed using a bin file in production, [as seen here](https://github.com/RocketChat/hubot-rocketchat-boilerplate/tree/master/bin).
Or via the package scripts locally using `npm run local` or `yarn local`

Using the boilerplate example, to start the bot in production, use
`bin/hubot -a rocketchat` - will install dependencies and run the bot with this
adapter.

[More info in Hubot's own docs here](https://hubot.github.com/docs/)

### Configuring Your Bot

[rcsdk-env]: https://github.com/rocketchat/rocket.chat.js.sdk#settings
[hubot-env]: https://hubot.github.com/docs/scripting/#environment-variables

In local development, the following can be set in an `.env` file. In production
they would need to be set on server startup.

The Rocket.Chat adapter implements the Rocket.Chat Node.js SDK to load all
settings from the environment. So the following are just some of those settings,
relevant to Hubot. It has some additional configs, [documented here][rcsdk-env].

| Env variable           | Description                                           |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Hubot**		           | A subset of relevant [Hubot env vars][hubot-env]     |
| `BOT_NAME` / `HUBOT_NAME`   | The programmatic name for listeners                   |
| `BOT_ALIAS` / `HUBOT_ALIAS`          | An alternate name for the bot to respond to           |
| `HUBOT_LOG_LEVEL`      | Verbosity of the bots console logs. Can be **info, warn or error**                 |
| `HUBOT_HTTPD`          | If the bot needs to listen to or make HTTP requests   |
| **Rocket.Chat SDK**    | A subset of relevant [SDK env vars][rcsdk-env]        |
| `ROCKETCHAT_URL`*      | URL of your Rocket.Chat instance, eg, https://open.rocket.chat       |
| `ROCKETCHAT_USER`*     | Username of a bot user that has been pre-created in your Rocket.Chat instance |
| `ROCKETCHAT_PASSWORD`* | Password for the user specified in ROCKETCHAT_USER       |
| `ROCKETCHAT_ROOM`      | The default room/s for the bot to listen in to (csv)  |
| `LISTEN_ON_ALL_PUBLIC` | Whether the bot should be listening everywhere        |
| `RESPOND_TO_DM`        | If the bot can respond privately or only in the open  |
| `RESPOND_TO_EDITED`    | If the bot should reply / re-reply to edited messages |
| `RESPOND_TO_LIVECHAT`  | If the bot should respond in livechat rooms           |
| `INTEGRATION_ID`			 | Name to ID source of messages in code (e.g Hubot)     |

If you wish that your bot listen to all public rooms and all private rooms it
is joined to set the env `LISTEN_ON_ALL_PUBLIC` to true. `ROCKETCHAT_ROOM` will
be ignored.

Be aware you *must* add the bot's user as a member of the new private group(s)
before it will respond. If you attempt to start the bot with a room listed in the ROCKETCHAT_ROOM variable that it's not already a member of, the bot will error on startup. 

## Connecting to Rocket.Chat

We have a couple of ways for you to get up and started with the adapter below.

### Docker

You can quickly spin up a docker image with:

```
docker run -it -e ROCKETCHAT_URL=<your rocketchat instance>:<port> \
	-e ROCKETCHAT_ROOM='' \
	-e LISTEN_ON_ALL_PUBLIC=true \
	-e ROCKETCHAT_USER=bot \
	-e ROCKETCHAT_PASSWORD=bot \
	-e HUBOT_NAME=bot \
	-e EXTERNAL_SCRIPTS=hubot-help,hubot-diagnostics \
	rocketchat/hubot-rocketchat
```

#### Custom Scripts

If you want to include your own custom scripts you can by doing:

```
docker run -it -e ROCKETCHAT_URL=<your rocketchat instance>:<port> \
	-e ROCKETCHAT_ROOM='' \
	-e LISTEN_ON_ALL_PUBLIC=true \
	-e ROCKETCHAT_USER=botname \
	-e ROCKETCHAT_PASSWORD=botpass \
	-e HUBOT_NAME=botname \
	-e EXTERNAL_SCRIPTS=hubot-help,hubot-diagnostics \
	-v $PWD/scripts:/home/hubot/scripts \
	rocketchat/hubot-rocketchat
```
#### Configuration Options

Here are all of the options you can specify to configure the bot.

On Docker you use: `-e VAR=Value`

Regular hubot via: `export VAR=Value` or add to pm2 etc

If `ROCKETCHAT_URL` is using `https://`, you **MUST** setup websocket
pass-through on your reverse proxy (NGINX, and so on) with a valid certificate
(not self-signed). Directly accessing Rocket.Chat without a reverse proxy via
`https://` is not possible.

### Verify your bot is working

Try:
```
rocketbot ping
```

And:
```
rocketbot help
```
The example bot under `scripts` directory responds to:
```
rocketbot report status
```

### v2.x.x Development

#### Docker

First clone the source and then move into the directory.

```
git clone git@github.com:RocketChat/hubot-rocketchat.git
cd hubot-rocketchat
```

Now we start the docker container.

```
docker run -it -e ROCKETCHAT_URL=<your rocketchat instance>:<port> \
	-e ROCKETCHAT_ROOM='' \
	-e LISTEN_ON_ALL_PUBLIC=true \
	-e ROCKETCHAT_USER=bot \
	-e ROCKETCHAT_PASSWORD=bot \
	-e HUBOT_NAME=bot \
	-e EXTERNAL_SCRIPTS=hubot-help,hubot-diagnostic \
	-v $PWD:/home/hubot/node_modules/hubot-rocketchat rocketchat/hubot-rocketchat
```

#### Standard

In a Hubot instance once `hubot-rocketchat` is added by npm or yarn, you can
replace the package with a development version directly:

- `cd node_modules` from the bot's project root
- `rm -rf hubot-rocketchat` to delete the published version
- `git clone git@github.com:RocketChat/hubot-rocketchat.git` to add dev version
- `cd hubot-rocketchat` move to dev path
- `npm install` install dependencies

#### Linked

Setting up a locally linked package is easier for continued development and/or
using the same development version of the adapter in multiple bots.

- Change directory to your development adapter path
- `npm link` or `yarn link` to set the origin of the link
- Change directory to your bot's project root
- `npm link hubot-rocketchat` or `yarn link hubot-rocketchat` to create the link

#### Important notes

* The first time you run the docker container, the image needs to be pulled from
the public docker registry and it will take some time.  Subsequent runs are
super fast.
* If you are not running Linux (i.e. if you are on a Mac or PC), you cannot use
$PWD to mount the volumes. Instead, [read this note here](https://docs.docker.com/userguide/dockervolumes/)
(the 2nd note on the page: *If you are using Boot2Docker...*) to determine the
absolute path where you must place the git-cloned directory.


### For v1.x.x  and v0.x.x of the Adatper

#### Docker-compose

If you want to use docker-compose for this task, add this for v0.1.4 adapter (this must be inserted in your docker-compose.yml):

```
# hubot, the popular chatbot (add the bot user first and change the password before starting this image)
hubot:
  image: rocketchat/hubot-rocketchat:v0.1.4
  environment:
    - ROCKETCHAT_URL=your-rocket-chat-instance-ip:3000 (e.g. 192.168.2.240:3000)
    - ROCKETCHAT_ROOM=
    - LISTEN_ON_ALL_PUBLIC=true
    - ROCKETCHAT_USER=username-of-your-bot
    - ROCKETCHAT_PASSWORD=yourpass
    - BOT_NAME=bot
    - GOOGLE_API_KEY=yourgoogleapikey
# you can add more scripts as you'd like here, they need to be installable by npm
    - EXTERNAL_SCRIPTS=hubot-help,hubot-seen,hubot-links,hubot-diagnostics,hubot-google,hubot-reddit,hubot-bofh,hubot-bookmark,hubot-shipit,hubot-maps
  links:
    - rocketchat:rocketchat
# this is used to expose the hubot port for notifications on the host on port 3001, e.g. for hubot-jenkins-notifier
  ports:
    - 3001:8080
```

 If you wish that your bot listen to all public rooms and all private rooms he is joined to let the env "ROCKETCHAT_ROOM" empty like in the example above and set the env "LISTEN_ON_ALL_PUBLIC" to true.

 Please take attention to some external scripts that are in the example above, some of them need your Google-API-Key in the docker compose file.

#### Alternative Node.js installation with [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) (nvm) in a local environment on Debian/Ubuntu

 ```
# adduser hubot
# su - hubot
$ curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.2/install.sh | bash
$ exit
# su - hubot
$ nvm install v4.8.5
$ npm update -g
$ npm install -g yo generator-hubot
$ mkdir hubot
$ cd hubot
$ yo hubot (answer questions and use "rocketchat" as adapter)
$ npm install coffee-script -save
 ```
 Make sure ~/hubot/bin/hubot is executable: `chmod 755 ./bin/hubot`

 If you need a redis database: `apt install redis-server`

 Set node version: `export NODE_VERSION=default`

 If you want to start your hubot with [systemd](https://github.com/hubotio/hubot/blob/master/examples/hubot.service) use `nvm-exec`:

 ```
ExecStart=/home/hubot/.nvm/nvm-exec /home/hubot/hubot/bin/hubot --adapter rocketchat
 ```
 See EnvironmentFile directive for using environment variables in systemd units

#### Add adapter to hubot

##### New install
You can specify the adapter during setup.

First you need to install hubot

```
npm install -g yo generator-hubot
```

Then you need to start the setup of the bot

```
mkdir myhubot
cd myhubot
yo hubot --adapter="rocketchat@1"
```

It'll ask you a few questions.

Alternatively you can actually answer the questions in one command:

```
yo hubot --owner="OWNER <owner@example.com>" --name="bot" --description="Bot" --adapter="rocketchat@0.1"
```

Also be sure to remember the name you specify.  This is what the bot will respond to in Rocket.Chat.

You will need to tell the adapter where your install is and what login information to use.

```
export ROCKETCHAT_ROOM=''
export LISTEN_ON_ALL_PUBLIC=true
export ROCKETCHAT_USER=bot
export ROCKETCHAT_PASSWORD=bot
export ROCKETCHAT_AUTH=password
```

Then start with: `bin/hubot -a rocketchat`

[More Info Here](https://hubot.github.com/docs/)

##### Existing install

If you already have hubot setup you can add the adapter.

By doing: `npm install hubot-rocketchat@2`

You will need to tell the adapter where your install is and what login
information to use.

```
export ROCKETCHAT_ROOM=''
export LISTEN_ON_ALL_PUBLIC=true
export ROCKETCHAT_USER=rocketbot
export ROCKETCHAT_PASSWORD=bot
export ROCKETCHAT_AUTH=ldap
```

Then starting your bot specifying the adapter: `bin/hubot -a rocketchat`

#### Verify your bot is working

Try:
```
rocketbot ping
```

And:
```
rocketbot help
```

The example bot under `scripts` directory responds to:
```
rocketbot report status
```

### Developers

We like to make development as easy on ourselves as possible. So passing the
love on to you!

#### Adapter Development

We'd love to have your help improving this adapter. PR's very welcome :smile:

##### Docker

First clone the source and then move into the directory.

```
git clone git@github.com:RocketChat/hubot-rocketchat.git
cd hubot-rocketchat
```

Now we start the docker container.

```
docker run -it -e ROCKETCHAT_URL=<your rocketchat instance>:<port> \
	-e ROCKETCHAT_ROOM='' \
	-e LISTEN_ON_ALL_PUBLIC=true \
	-e ROCKETCHAT_USER=bot \
	-e ROCKETCHAT_PASSWORD=bot \
	-e ROCKETCHAT_AUTH=password \
	-e BOT_NAME=bot \
	-e EXTERNAL_SCRIPTS=hubot-pugme,hubot-help \
	-v $PWD:/home/hubot/node_modules/hubot-rocketchat rocketchat/hubot-rocketchat
```

#### Standard

Installed in hubot you'd hop over into `node_modules`.

Delete the hubot-rocketchat folder.

Then clone the git repo.

```
git clone git@github.com:RocketChat/hubot-rocketchat.git
cd hubot-rocketchat
npm install
```

#### Additional details
Look under the `scripts` directory, you will find a very basic bot there.

Just add your own script in the directory to have it loaded.  If you are new to hubot script writing, find out more [here](https://hubot.github.com/docs/scripting/).

If you find a bug or compatibility problem, please open an issue.

If you have any enhancements or feature requests, create an issue.  If you like what you see, please star the repo.

Finally, if you have created a bot that other users may find useful, please contribute it.


#### Some important notes

* The first time you run the docker container, the image needs to be pulled from the public docker registry and it will take some time.  Subsequent runs are super fast.
* If you are not running Linux (i.e. if you are on a Mac or PC), you cannot use $PWD to mount the volumes.  Instead, [read this note here](https://docs.docker.com/userguide/dockervolumes/) (the 2nd note on the page: *If you are using Boot2Docker...*) to determine the absolute path where you must place the git-cloned directory.

### CONTRIBUTORS WANTED

While it is functional, the current adapter is very basic.  We need all the help we can get to add capabilities.

Become part of the project, just pick an issue and file a PR.

The adapter code is under the `src` directory.   To test modified adapter code, exit (ctrl-c) the container and run it again.

### FAQ

Q:  I am not trying to stage a denial of service attack, why would I ever want to write a bot?

A:  There are many positive and productive use cases for bots.    Imagine a customer service support chat.   As soon as a customer enters the support channel, a bot immediately identifies the customer and then:
* fetches recent sales information from the sales dept server
* fetches personal information from the customer data base
* fetches latest notes made by her/his salesperson from the CRM system
* scans the customer's facebook and twitter posts
* obtains details of the last support ticket for this customer

Putting it altogether and then private message the service rep with the information.

Another use-case is a load test bot, imagine a bot that accepts the command:

````
rocketbot loadtest europe 25, asia 50, usa 100, canada 10
````
This command specifies a distribution of test bot instances, to be created across globally located data centers.

Once received, the bot:
* parses the distribution
* concurrently ssh to remote Kubernetes controllers and spawns the specified number of test bot instances to start the load test

Q:   The architecture of hubot-rocketchat looks interesting, can you tell me more about it?

A:  Sure, it is based on hubot-meteorchat.  hubot-meteorchat is the hubot integration project for Meteor based chats and real-time messaging systems.  Its driver based architecture simplifies creation and customization of adapter for new systems. For example, the hubot-rocketchat integration is just hubot-meteorchat + Rocket.Chat driver.

Learn more about hubot-meteorchat and other available drivers [at this link](https://github.com/Sing-Li/hubot-meteorchat).
